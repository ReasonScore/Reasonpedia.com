We even have a process of organizing and labeling the assumptions and reasons we found in such a way that you can quickly find where they are wrong.

You can publicly tell us what we got wrong by <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Hey%20%40Reasonpedia%20">tweeting it to everyone</a>.

You can also let us know by

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://forms.gle/EgBAjbkpXVFDPLzG9">This form</a> that requires an email address</li>
<li> <a href="https://forms.gle/ShiEFwCdfe999GZu5">This form</a> that does not require an email address (Google may still track you)</li>
</ul>
