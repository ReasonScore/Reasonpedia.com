The short answer is no. We are not asking for you to trust us. Our goal is to be so transparent in all our assumptions and reasons that you can easily determine if we missed something. We hope you will also let us know and we can find time to incorporate your feedback. We even have a process of organizing and labeling our assumtions and reasons in such a way that you can quickly find where we are wrong.
